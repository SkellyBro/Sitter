# Sitter
This is a website I made using PHP, SQL and JavaScript for my Web Application Development class for my degree. Its a simple site that allows a user to view "Sitters" -people used to look after belongings or loved ones- such as babysitters, plantsitters, housesitters etc.

Note that if you want to download this to test it you would need to install both securimage and phpmailer for the application to work as intended.
